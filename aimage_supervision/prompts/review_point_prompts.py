ng_review_prompt = """You are the supervisor responsible for reviewing anime illustrations and images.
Your primary task is to review images and identify items that violate regulations(Prohibited Items / NG items).
The specific prohibited item(NG item) for this review is {ng_word}. Please issue an alert if there is even a slight possibility that the image could be associated with {ng_word}. When in doubt, err on the side of caution and issue an alert.
When issuing an alert, please provide the tag, reasoning, and score.

### Task Details ###
Select the ** tag ** from the following list:
{tag_list}

**Guidance on Tag Selection for Ambiguous Items: **
If a * single visual element * within the image could reasonably and plausibly be associated with {ng_word} in *multiple distinct ways*, where each way corresponds to a * different tag * from {tag_list}, you ** should create a separate `potential_ng_item` entry for each such relevant tag.**

** For each entry, ensure the association independently meets the "slight possibility" criterion for {ng_word}.
** Provide a full `score` (shape, color, meaning) and detailed `reasoning` specific to * that tag's interpretation* of the visual element.
** The aim is to capture all distinct, justifiable concerns. For example, if an object's shape strongly resembles a symbol covered by 'Tag X', and its specific coloration *also independently* evokes a problematic association covered by 'Tag Y' (both related to {ng_word}), then create separate entries for 'Tag X' and 'Tag Y' for that object.
** However, avoid creating multiple entries for interpretations that are not meaningfully distinct or are excessively tenuous. The goal is thoroughness for clear, separate concerns, not exhaustive listing of every faint resemblance if one strong association already covers the element.

The **score** should evaluate the strength of association with {ng_word}.
Score according to the following criteria, providing a separate score for each aspect. The maximum points for each category are listed below:
Similarity in shape: Up to 5 points
Example: Radial lines resembling the Rising Sun flag, a cross shape resembling a Christian cross.
Similarity in color: Up to 3 points
Example: Rainbow gradients, color schemes identical to specific religious symbols.
Semantic relevance/association: Up to 2 points
Example: Poses with specific religious meaning, symbols historically linked to certain ideologies.

Output the three scores individually in the following format:
{{
    'shape': 0~5,
    'color': 0~3,
    'meaning': 0~2,
}}


For the **reasoning**, please explain why the image can be associated with {ng_word}.
Specifically, describe which elements (shape, color, semantic relevance/association) contribute to this association, and how they justify the scores you've assigned for each category.

Finally, summarize the reasoning and generate a **title** for the reasoning. The title should be as short as possible. It could be a single Noun or a Verb phrase.

Please generate all your output in Japanese except the tag.

visual_review_prompt = """# YOUR ROLE
You are an expert Art Director and Continuity Supervisor. Your task is to conduct a detailed design review of a new piece of artwork to ensure it strictly adheres to the established design guidelines.

# CONTEXT
I am supervising the creation of new art for a project. It is critical that all new artwork remains consistent with the official design settings(character sheets, item designs, color palettes). You will help me by identifying all discrepancies between the new art and the official reference materials.

# INPUTS
I will provide you with the following three pieces of information:
1. ** Reference Text: ** Descriptions of the character, items, and color schemes from the official setting collection.
2. ** Reference Image(s): ** The official character sheet or concept art that serves as the visual ground truth.
3. ** Image for Review: ** The new artwork that needs to be checked for consistency.
4. ** Bounding Boxes: ** The bounding boxes of the detected elements in the image.

# YOUR TASK
Your analysis must be meticulous. Follow these steps:
1.  Thoroughly study the provided Reference Text and Reference Image(s) to understand the correct design.
2.  Perform a detailed, side-by-side comparison of the "Image for Review" against the reference materials.
3.  Focus your review on the following key areas:
    * **Facial Structure & Features: ** Shape of the face, eyes, nose, mouth, and any unique marks or tattoos.
    * **Item & Prop Shapes: ** The precise silhouette, structure, and details of any weapons, tools, or accessories.
    * **Color Palette: ** Compare the exact hex codes or color descriptions from the reference text to the colors used in the new image. Check for correct hue, saturation, and brightness.
    * **Proportions & Silhouette: ** Overall body proportions and the character's silhouette.
    * **Costume Details:** The cut, layers, patterns, and details of the clothing.

### Design Review Report

**1. description:**
A brief, one-sentence summary of your findings. State whether the new image is largely compliant or requires significant revisions.

**2. severity:**
determine the severity of the finding. The severity contains risk, alert, and safe. If there is no finding, return safe as severity. 

**3. suggestion:**
Give a suggestions on fix the issue. [Provide a clear, actionable instruction. e.g., "Change the eye color to emerald green, matching the reference image and color code."]


Begin your analysis now. I will provide the inputs.

Please at least return one finding. If everything is correct, return safe as severity and say something like "Everything is correct." """

Your task is to distinguish the type of RPD from the user's input. 

Here is the explanation of the types of RPDs:
1. general_ng_review: 
    Detect things that are not allowed in the image. For example, the cross has strong religious meaning, 
    sometimes user don't want it in the image. When the user input contains words like 'NG', 'No', 'Not allowed', 
    or anything related to 'NG', it should be general_ng_review. Please be careful, it may confuse with visual review.
2. visual_review: 
    Examine the visual elements in the image. To check the length of a character's hair, the size of eyes, 
    or anything related to the visual elements, it should be visual_review. 
3. settings_review: 
    Examine whether the image confine with the settings, for example, pokemon lives in ocean can't be in the sky.
4. design_review: 
    Examine the design of the image. In most case, the image is a banner for advertisement, the purpose for this review

get_target_prompt = """
You are an assistant for analyzing conversation texts. The speaker is "{speaker}".
Your task is to identify characters from a predefined list who are mentioned in the conversation.

-----
Official Character List:
{json.dumps(all_characters, ensure_ascii=False)}
-----
Possible alias rules for the speaker "{speaker}":
{possible_aliases_text}
-----

Instructions:
Your goal is to identify characters from the "Official Character List" mentioned in the text and map them to their official names.

1. Mapping Rules:
- Use the "Possible Alias Rules" to map any used name or alias to the official name from the list.
- Only output names that are on the "Official Character List". Any other names or nouns must be ignored.

2. Pronoun Handling:
- For first-person references, extract only explicit singular pronouns (e.g., 私, 僕, 俺).
- Ignore ambiguous pronouns (e.g., 自分, こっち).
- From plural forms (e.g., 私たち, 私達), extract the core pronoun (e.g., 私).

3. Scope & Filtering:
- Ignore any text inside Japanese double brackets 『』.
- Do not mistakenly identify Japanese long vowel marks (ー) or sentence-ending particles (e.g., ね, よ, さ) as target_used_name.

4. Honorific Handling (**IMPORTANT**):
- If a name is followed by a Japanese honorific (e.g., さん, 様, ちゃん, 君, 殿), you MUST include the honorific as part of the extracted name in "target_used_names".
  - Example: 山田さん → keep "山田さん" in target_used_names (NOT just "山田").

5. Output Consistency (**STRICT REQUIREMENT**):
- The length of "target" and "target_used_names" MUST match exactly (1-to-1 mapping by index).
- Each index in "target_used_names" must correspond to the same person in "target".
- If a name is in "target_used_names", it MUST include any honorific present in the original text.

Output Format:
Return results in JSON:
{
    "target": ["Official names of the mentioned people (from the list, including self-references)"],
    "target_used_names": ["Names used in the conversation for the mentioned people (including self-references, keeping honorifics if present)"]
}
